As scientific questions become more complex, the capabilities of scientists to do 
research will need to be augmented with AI systems.  
This project will develop an open architecture for cognitive AI scientists 
that can formulate scientific questions, devise strategies to answer them, 
and place new findings in the context of the original question. 
A core aspects of this research is capturing scientific knowledge to reason 
about open questions, construct plausible hypotheses, formulate appropriate 
methods to test them, and interpret the results obtained.  The proposed project 
will be carried out in two phases. In the first phase, we will develop the 
conceptual framework and prototype its core competencies and demonstrate it 
in two scientific disciplines.  In the second phase, we will exercise the 
conceptual framework in new domains, and extend it with capabilities to 
automatically write sections of scientific articles describing approach 
and method in selected domains.  This research will advances many areas of AI, 
including cognitive architectures, knowledge representation, reasoning, 
planning, learning, explanation, and metareasoning.

Major societal and environmental challenges require forecasting how natural processes 
and human activities affect one another. There are many areas of the globe where climate 
affects water resources and therefore food availability, with major economic and social 
implications. Today, such analyses require significant effort to integrate highly 
heterogeneous models from separate disciplines, including geosciences, agriculture, 
economics, and social sciences. Model integration requires resolving semantic, 
spatio-temporal, and execution mismatches, which are largely done by hand today 
and may take more than two years. This project will develop a new approach to use a wide
range of semantics in modeling environments in order to significantly reduce the time 
needed to develop new integrated models while ensuring their utility and accuracy.  </i>

<i>
This project is developing a scientific discovery system (DISK) that captures data 
analytics expertise, applies it automatically and routinely to scientific data repositories, 
and highlights interesting findings and potential discoveries.  We are investigating three 
fundamental questions: 1) Can we identify domain-independent computational processes and 
use them to make autonomous hypothesis-driven discoveries from existing datasets? 
2) Can we effectively capture domain-specific knowledge needed to apply those processes 
in a new science domain? 3) Can these processes be automatically combined in novel ways 
and enable new kinds of discoveries?  Our approach is to automate the hypothesize-test-evaluate 
discovery cycle with an intelligent system that a scientist can task with lines of inquiry 
over existing data repositories.  The system will then autonomously test hypotheses by 
running analytic workflows on the data and examining the results to report new findings 
back to the scientist.  DISK extends the existing 
WINGS semantic workflow 
system. We are initially applying DISK in multi-omics and subsurface water modeling.</i>

<i>
Paleoclimatology datasets are key to understanding low-frequency, natural climate 
variability that significantly modulates anthropogenic global warming.  However, 
there is currently no universal way to share paleoclimate data between users or 
machines, hindering integration and synthesis.  The majority of observations are 
gathered by independent scientists with no formal language for describing their 
data and metadata to each other, or to machines, in a standardized fashion. This is 
further aggravated by the diversity of data (e.g. trees, ice cores, lake or marine 
sediments, corals, mollusks, speleothems), each having very different characteristics, 
and the diversity of measured quantities (e.g. trace metal concentrations, isotope ratios, 
layer thickness, etc.).  This data diversity is typical in other sciences, particularly 
in ecology.  Managing and integrating this kind of scientific data is challenging because: 
(1) metadata creation and data curation requires expert knowledge; (2) top-down data 
management approaches do not tend to be effective; (3) existing infrastructure does 
not foster standardization.  Therefore, there is a critical need for a flexible platform 
enabling crowdsourced data curation and standards development through community 
participation.  In this project we are investigating a socio-technical system that has 
the potential to engage a broad user base in geoscientific data curation.  Our approach 
is based on semantic wikis that incorporate editorial and community-driven processes 
that follow principles from social sciences research on successful on-line communities.

the Sun-Earth system. The observatory creates an integrated package of software 
tools contributed by researchers with specific capabilities, and designed to enable 
integration of diverse observational data. Features of the toolkit include: 
(1) linking diverse datasets from multiple data repositories and automatically 
mapping them to a common user-specified coordinate grid; (2) implementing the 
well-known Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynamics (AMIE) procedure 
for assimilation of this data to yield a global picture; and (3) using the OntoSoft

SciSpark is a framework for scaling scientific computations that extends Apache Spark 
with new capabilities for processing science data standards for large-scale data, 
with a particular focus on climate data.  Remote sensing data and climate model 
output are multi-dimensional arrays of massive sizes locked away in heterogeneous 
file formats (HDF5/4, NetCDF 3/4) and metadata models (HDF-EOS, CF) making it 
difficult to perform multi-stage, iterative science processing since each stage 
requires writing and reading data to and from disk. Apache Spark implements the 
MapReduce paradigm for parallel computing while emphasizing in-memory computation, 
and so outperforms the disk-based MapReduce implementation in Apache Hadoop by 100x 
in memory and by 10x on disk. SciSpark will enable scalable model evaluation by 
executing large-scale comparisons of A-Train satellite observations to model grids 
on a cluster of 100 to 1000 compute nodes. This 2nd generation capability for NASA's 
Regional Climate Model Evaluation System (RCMES) will compute simple climate metrics 
at interactive speeds, and extend to quite sophisticated iterative algorithms such as 
machine-learning (ML) based clustering of temperature PDFs, and even graph-based 
algorithms for searching for Mesocale Convective Complexes. The goals of SciSpark are to: 
(1) Decrease the time to compute comparison statistics and plots from minutes to seconds; 
(2) Allow for interactive exploration of time-series properties over seasons and years; 
(3) Decrease the time for satellite data ingestion into RCMES to hours; (4) Allow for 
Level-2 comparisons with higher-order statistics or PDF's in minutes to hours; and 
(5) Move RCMES into a near real time decision-making platform.</i>

In recent years, intelligent systems have demonstrated significant transformative impact 
in the commercial sector.  These techniques have been applied to geosciences with some 
success, but they are inadequate to meet the challenges presented by geosciences research. 
First, using data alone is insufficient to create models of the complex phenomena under 
study. Second, geoscientists need to reach across disciplines to synthesize disparate 
data and models, which requires extensive qualification and context. Third, scientists 
need powerful partnerships with computers in order to explore complex hypotheses and 
understand how new findings relate to the existing body of knowledge. Therefore, in order 
to tackle complex geosciences phenomena new approaches are needed.  The goal of this 
project is to produce a report outlining a research agenda for intelligent systems in 
geosciences, and their potential to overcome the challenges that geoscientists face.</i>

Geographic data is increasingly being shared, interchanged and used for purposes other 
than the producers� intended purpose. In addition to traditional institutional sources 
of information, recent crowdsourcing approaches have proven to be useful additions to 
traditional geospatial data sources.  Yet the timeliness and currency advantages of 
crowdsourcing bring additional burdens regarding quality and fitness-for-use.  
Dynamically integrated datasets created through Web mashups are constantly appearing, 
resulting in a variety of new geospatial resources that deliver customized information.  
Producers expect that their data will have unanticipated uses, while consumers have 
limited insight of into the integrity of producers and data and whether they can be trusted.  
Therefore, information about the quality of available geographic data is vital to the 
process of selecting information in that the value of data to a consumer is directly 
related to its quality.  This project investigated a data quality ontology for 
geospatial data, and its mapping to the Content Maturity Model proposed by NGA.</i>

Geosciences software embodies crucial scientific knowledge, and as such it should be explicitly 
captured, curated, managed, and disseminated. The goal of this project is to create a system 
for software stewardship in geosciences that will empower scientists to manage their software 
as valuable scientific assets. Scientific software stewardship requires a combination of 
cyberinfrastructure, social infrastructure, and professional development infrastructure. 
The framework will result in an open transparent and broader access to scientific software 
to other scientists, software professionals, students, and decision makers. It will 
significantly improve the adoption of open data and open software initiatives, improve 
reproducibility, and advance scientific scholarship.

by developing an integrated hydrodynamic model of lakes as connected to the 
broader hydrologic network to quantify water, material, nutrient and energy fluxes, 
which is potentially transformative for limnology.  It will also advance 
socio-technical research in the context of distributed scientific collaboration.

Big data analytics has emerged as a widely desirable skill in many areas. Although 
courses are now available on a variety of aspects of big data, there is a lack of a 
broad and accessible course that covers the variety of topics that concern big data analytics. 
As a result, acquiring practical data analytics skills is out of reach 
for many students and professionals, posing severe limitations to our ability as a 
society to take advantage of our vast digital data resources.  The goal of this 
work is to develop curriculum materials for big data analytics to provide broad 
and practical training in data analytics in the context of real-world and 
science-grade datasets and data analytics methods. A key technical basis of the 
approach is the use of workflows that capture expert analytic methods that will 
be presented to users for practice with real-world datasets within pre-defined 
lesson units.  The results of this work include lesson units for learning 
expert-level skills in big data analytics, a framework for non-programmers to 
understand basic concepts in big data analytics, and a hands-on workflow 
framework to learn by direct experimentation and exploration with scientific data.

Tracking the provenance of geospatial information is important in order to 
understand how to trust and use the information based on what sources generated it 
and the processes used to integrate it.  This project will analyze the use of the 
recent W3C PROV standard in the context of geospatial information integration, 
particularly to study scalability, granularity, and presentation of provenance.

Geoscience and environmental science software is crucial for data analysis to 
generate new knowledge and understanding about the Earth. Because reproducibility 
of operations, calculations, and predictions done with this software is important 
for science, commercial, and regulatory applications, it is important that the 
software generated by geoscientists and their colleagues be captured, curated, 
managed, and shared.  The GeoSoft project brings together computer scientists, 
geoscientists, and social scientists to assist scientists to describe basic characteristics of their code and share it.  GeoSoft will be a social site 
where scientists can discover alternative approaches to release free software, 
use intelligent interfaces to explain how their software works, and form 
productive communities around software projects.  This research has the 
potential to fundamentally transform geosciences by making scientific software 
readily available to researchers and citizen scientists for efficient data 
analysis.

This project will investigate a new generation of provenance-rich social knowledge collection 
systems that will greatly improve the ability of people to create online communities of interest 
and share information.  The research will transform the state of the art in social content 
collection in several important ways. First, social knowledge collection systems will be 
augmented to support contributors to structure factual content, so that information can be 
aggregated to answer reasonably interesting albeit simple factual queries. We will build on 
a semantic wiki framework to allow users to create structured factual content as 
object-property-value triples. It will not assume pre-defined ontologies, but rather 
develop algorithms that analyze current content and suggest opportunities for structuring 
contributions so they can be aggregated to answer simple queries. Second, they will include 
detailed provenance records that reflect how the content was created, allowing contributors 
to enter alternative viewpoints and enabling consumers to make quality and trust judgments. 
The research will include developing algorithms that derive trust metrics from the provenance 
records, and to allow users to define views on the content based on provenance criteria.  
It will create novel approaches to propagate trust across content topics and categories 
and complement existing algorithms that propagate trust in social networks.  Third, the 
systems will proactively guide contributors to invest effort where it is most needed, 
developing novel algorithms to detect knowledge gaps, and by allowing users to define 
queries that will be used to drive further contributions.</i>

In order to address the ambitious research agenda put forward by many science disciplines, 
many challenges must be addressed in the areas of information sciences, intelligent systems, 
and human-computer interaction. Data modeling and integration still require large investments 
of scientist time and effort.  The scientific literature grows so quickly in many areas that 
it becomes unmanageable for scientists.  Many aspects of the scientific discovery process are 
often largely manual and could be automated, improved, or made more efficient.  Better 
interfaces for collaboration, visualization, and understanding would significantly improve 
scientific practice.  The goal of this project is to produce a report outlining the 
opportunities that scientific discoveries present to information sciences and intelligent

Traditional cybersecurity has focused on techniques to analyze and eliminate vulnerabilities 
in a network, often in response to actual security breaches of previously unknown weaknesses. 
Recognizing that in practice network operations can never be fully secure, a major focus of 
recent research is on intrusions that are assumed to be on-going in the network by one or 
more malicious parties. In this new view on cybersecurity, a key desired capability is to 
be able to accomplish a mission even while the network is compromised and subject to 
deception. However, traditional network models lack a representation of the mission and 
of how network resources are utilized to accomplish various aspects of the mission.  
In this project, we will investigate a new approach to develop a general framework for 
representing models of mission goals and tasks, and to exploit those models to make a 
mission more robust to deception operations co-occurring in the network.  These 
mission-centered network models (MCNMs) will build on and extend current two-layered 
(logical/physical) network models by integrating a new layer of task-level representations 
of the mission into those models. In this new task-oriented layer, a mission can be 
characterized as a set of goals, each accomplished by a set of interdependent tasks 
that place requirements on the network resources. The system can then dynamically 
control the mappings of those tasks onto network resources using a variety of algorithms 
that take into account which resources are currently compromised. As a result, a mission
can be protected from ongoing intrusion and deception activities by dynamically reallocating 
resources as they become compromised and by examining provenance records of task outcomes to 
determine their reliance on compromised resources.  MCNMs can be used to determine which 
resources are critical for any given mission, to prioritize the use of uncompromised resources, 
to accomplish and estimate the trust on mission tasks when resources are compromised, and to 
determine the practical impact on the mission of deception activities. MCNMs will enable a 
new approach to cybersecurity in network-based operations.

Scientific computing has entered a new era of scale and sharing with
the arrival of cyberinfrastructure for computational experimentation.
A key emerging concept is scientific workflows, which provide a
declarative representation of scientific applications as complex
compositions of software components and the dataflow among them.
Workflow systems manage their execution in distributed resources,
track provenance of analysis products, and enable rapid
reproducibility of results.  In current cyberinfrastructure, there are
well understood mechanisms for sharing data, instruments, and
computing resources.  This is not the case for sharing workflows,
though there is an emerging movement for sharing analysis processes in
the scientific community.  In this grant, we are investigating
computational mechanisms for sharing workflows as a key missing
element of cyberinfrastructure for scientific research.  We are
exploring three major research topics.  First, we are eliciting new
requirements that workflow sharing poses over current techniques to
share software tools and libraries.  Second, we want to understand how
shared workflow catalogs should be designed.  Existing shared data
catalogs are a successful model, but software artifacts require
different representations and access functions.  Finally, we are
studying what sharing paradigms might be appropriate for scientific
communities, exploring environments ranging from traditional
server-based architectures to wikis to Web 2.0 social sites.

Much of science today relies on software to make new discoveries.  
This software embodies scientific analyses that are frequently 
composed of several application components and created collaboratively 
by different researchers. Computational workflows have recently emerged as 
a paradigm to manage these large-scale and large-scope scientific analyses.  
Workflows represent computations that are often executed in geographically 
distributed settings, their interdependencies, their requirements and their 
data products. The design of these workflows is at the core of today's 
scientific discovery processes and must be treated as scientific products 
in their own right.  The focus of this research is to develop the foundations 
for a science of design of scientific processes embodied in the new artifact 
that is the computational workflow.  The work will integrate best practices 
and lessons learned in existing workflow applications, and extend them in 
order to define and formalize design principles of computational workflows. 
This work will result in a fundamentally new approach to designing workflows 
that will greatly improve the scientific software design methodology by 
defining and formalizing design principles, and by familiarizing the 
scientific community with these effective workflow design processes.

Distributed workflows are emerging as a key technology to conduct large-scale 
and large-scope scientific applications in earthquake science, physics, 
astronomy, and many other sciences.  In this new project, we will investigate 
the use of workflow technologies for Artificial Intelligence applications with 
a particular focus on data analysis and knowledge discovery tasks.  Based on 
the data to be analyzed, an initial workflow template is formed by selecting 
from a library of known-to-work compositions of general-purpose machine 
learning algorithms.  The workflow template is specialized through knowledge-based 
selection and configuration of algorithms.  Finally, the workflow is mapped to 
available resources and restructured to improve execution time.  Data analysis 
and knowledge discovery applications will benefit from the automation, scale, 
and distributed data and resource integration supported by distributed workflow 
systems.  We will also conduct new research in important aspects of workflow 
systems.  To what extend can we represent complex algorithms and their subtle 
differences so that they can be automatically selected and configured to 
satisfy the stated application requirements?  Can we develop learning 
techniques that improve the performance of the workflow system by exploiting 
an episodic memory of prior workflow executions?  What mechanisms will be

routines need to be executed, the data flow amongst them, and relevant 
execution details. Workflows provide a systematic way to capture scientific 
methodology and provide provenance information for their results. Robust and 
flexible workflow creation, mapping, and execution are largely open research

This project will develop a domain-specific programming system supporting 
Petascale application optimization of molecular dynamics simulation, in which 
applications will be viewed as workflows consisting of composable components to 
be mapped to a diversity of machine resources. The application components will 
be viewed as dynamically adaptive algorithms for which there exist a set of 
variants and parameters that can be chosen to develop an optimized implementation. 
A variant describes a distinct implementation of a code segment, perhaps even a 
different algorithm. A paramater is an unbound variable that affects application 
performance. By encoding an application in this way, we can capture a large set 
of possible application mappings with a very compact representation. Because 
the space of mappings is prohibitively large, the system captures and utilizes 
domain knowledge from the domain scientists and designers of the compiler, 
run-time and performance models to prune most of the possible implementation. 
Knowledge representation and machine learning techniques utilize this domain 
knowledge and past experience to navigate the search space efficiently. 
Incorporating cognitive search techniques and taking advantage of parallel 
resources, these alternative implementations are searched automatically by 
tools to find a high-quality implementation.

We are developing Phosphorus, a knowledge-based matcher that accepts
a user's description of a needed service as input and responds with a
ranked list of agents that have the capability to provide that service.
The Phosphorus matcher will exploit subsumption, 
goal reformulation, and partial match. The
matcher will also be experienced-based, using learning techniques to
improve the utility of its matches over time.

This project will develop, in an integration 
effort with other
research groups, tools to enable domain experts 
to extend knowledge bases by using natural language interfaces,
commonsense reasoning, and analogy-based reasoning. 
Our group's contributions
focus on tools to formulate follow-up 
questions when users have not provided 
sufficient knowledge, and on the acquisition
of problem solving and process knowledge.
The integrated system will be tested by two challenge
problems designed by DARPA.  One problem is based on
how our system will acquire graduate level knowledge 
of biology from a textbook and then answer the questions
at the end of the chapter.  Another challenge 
problem will require developing 
expert-level knowledge-based
techniques for advanced genome annotation and 
exploitation for pathogen countermeasures.

This project is developing an editor that allows users to 
change and extend an initial grammar of objectives.
This editor is integrated with the MasterMind objectives editor and 
includes acquisition wizards developed with EXPECT knowledge acquisition
techniques.
The editor was delivered in October 2000, and is now being integrated
into the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) and is 
expected to be delivered to Air Operation Centers around the world
by August 2001.

This work extends the ISI EXPECT architecture to include
several novel approaches including the derivation and use of knowledge
Interdependency Models, script-based knowledge acquisition, the
integration of natural language techniques in knowledge acquisition
tools, and the use of background knowledge to guide users in adding new
knowledge to a system.  We participated in the HPKB annual Challenge
Problems, as well as in the Knowledge Acquisition Critical Component
Experiment held at the Army Battle Command Battle Lab in Ft Leavenworth,
KS, in August 1999.  Several Army officers successfully 
used EXPECT's knowledge
acquisition tools to extend the knowledge base.

EXPECT is a user-centered environment to 
develop and maintain knowledge bases.  
It includes knowledge acquisition tools,
problem solving and reasoning modules, and 
a facility to generate natural language paraphrases
of its knowledge.  EXPECT was used to develop
plan evaluation and critiquing systems
for logistics planning and for air campaign planning.
We participated in the Fourth Integrated
Feasibility Demonstration (IFD-4) of the Planning
Initiative, held at US Air Force Air Combat Command in June 1996
and in the Multi-Agent Planning, Visualization, and Simulation (MAPViS)
integrated demonstration in 1998.
