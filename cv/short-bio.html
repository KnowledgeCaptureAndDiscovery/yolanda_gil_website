received her bachelor’s degree (“Licenciatura”) from the Polytechnic University of Madrid in Spain in 1985, and her Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1992 with a focus on artificial intelligence and cognitive science. She then joined the University of Southern California and is currently Fellow and Senior Director for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Strategy at the Information Sciences Institute, Director of AI and Data Science Initiatives in the Viterbi School of Engineering, and Research Professor in Computer Science and in Spatial Sciences. She is Director of Data Science programs with over 1,000 students and has created 10 joint interdisciplinary degrees across USC schools.  Dr. Gil collaborates with scientists in many domains on semantic workflows and knowledge capture, provenance and trust, 
task-centered collaboration, and automated discovery.  She has published over 250 peer-reviewed articles and has received best paper conference awards and journal recognitions for interdisciplinary research in AI for climate, neuroscience, and health.  In 2019 she co-chaired the 
CRA/AAAI 20-Year Artificial Intelligence Research Roadmap for the US with key strategic 
recommendations based on extensive community engagement.  She initiated and led the 
W3C Provenance Group that resulted in a widely-used standard that provides the 
foundations for trust on the Web. She is a Fellow of the Association for Computing 
Machinery (ACM), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the Cognitive Science Society (CSS), and the Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). She is also Fellow of 
the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and served 
as its 24th President. In 2022, she became the first computer scientist to receive the M. Lee Allison Award for Outstanding Contributions to Geoinformatics and Data Science from the Geological Society of America (GSA). </p>
